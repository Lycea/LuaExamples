Small projects made with löve/lua 

 #### love2d examples
   - imgui demo reimplementation with lua api(uncomplete)
   - shader(pixel)
      - rgb_channel_switcher
   - doodles / Screensaver 
    -> just a small programm which looks nice like a screensaver probably
   - particle editor -> pacrticle editor made with and for the löve particle api ... still misses save function
   
   
   
#### lua examples
   - file runner  -> give it a starting directory and it will return you a structure of files and folders in it
       -> can be quite easily adjusted to whatever you want to return from it
   - save file loader
       - a try to possibly implement a terraria map generator after a given example of indices for structures :)
